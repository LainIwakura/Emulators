Just emulators I might mess around with.

Currently have working
-Chip8. Only works on Linux (test with Arch Linux)

Currently working on:
-Emulator research. Next emulator might be a Z80 or Gameboy, which
 is a modified Z80

On hold:
-SuperChip8 (SChip). Extended version of Chip8
 On hold because it's fairly simple. I could probably finish it
 in an afternoon, so I'd prefer to devote time to a gameboy emulator.
